Non-Negative Orthogonal Matching Pursuit toolbox (NNOMPtools)

These Matlab files are prepared for the simulations of the following paper:

"Fast Non-Negative Orthogonal Matching Pursuit" by Mehrdad Yaghoobi, Di Wu and Mike E. Davies, submitted to the IEEE Signal Processing Letter.

The code will run faster on the machines having parallel processing capabilities. It has been tested on a Linux workstation and there is no guarantee for working on other platforms or other versions of Matlab. The use of the code for research is free, but please cite the titled paper. For other uses, please contact the authors.
